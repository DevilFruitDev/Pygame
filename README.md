Alien Invasion Game
Alien Invasion is a classic arcade-style game inspired by Space Invaders. Built using Python and Pygame, this project is a passion project that combines the excitement of game development with the thrill of defending Earth from alien forces. Players control a spaceship to fend off waves of alien enemies, collect power-ups, and survive as long as possible!

A Personal Note
A couple of years ago, I picked up a programming book on Amazon and thought it’d be exciting to start coding by creating a game. I kept putting it off, always telling myself I’d get to it “later.” Now, two years later, I’m not much closer to finishing than when I first started—but this time, I’m committed. My goal is to finally complete the game, continue improving it, and share my progress along the way. I may not be the best, but I’m determined to see this through. If you’ve taken the time to read this, thank you—it really means a lot.
